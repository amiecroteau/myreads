## TL;DR

To get started:
* To get all REACT dependcies to install
  1. Install ['yarn'](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) on your system
  2. Run `yarn install` in the terminal to install all project dependencies.
  3. Start the development server with `yarn install`
* other web building packages are usable including `yarn install`


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Acknowledgements
I followed a tutorial during development of this application. The tutorial was conducted by Udacity Project Mentor ['Ryan Waite'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acJHkd6K5kI&feature=youtu.be&t=2507)
